# Decisions

Every non-obvious choice, with the reasoning, so it can be overridden later without
re-deriving the argument. Newest phase last.

## Phase 0 — setup

### D-001: Repository licence changed from MIT to GPLv2

The repository was initialised with an MIT `LICENSE`. The port is a derivative work of
`bg_pmove.c`, `cm_trace.c` and the OpenArena gamecode, all GPL-2.0-only, so MIT was not an
available option. `LICENSE` is now the GPLv2 text verbatim, and `package.json` declares
`"license": "GPL-2.0-or-later"`.

Every file that contains ported logic carries an id Software / OpenArena attribution header.
Files that are original to this port (the asset pipeline, the meep integration layer) carry a
plain GPLv2 header without the id attribution, because claiming id's copyright on code they
did not write would be wrong in the other direction.

**meep is unaffected by this.** GPLv2 binds this repository's own source; it does not reach a
proprietary peer dependency that is neither vendored nor linked into a distributed binary.
That is why the "never vendor, never bundle" constraint is enforced mechanically rather than
by good intentions — see D-002.

### D-002: meep stays external, enforced by the build config

`@woosh/meep-engine` is declared in `peerDependencies` only. It is installed locally so the
port can be developed and typechecked, but:

- `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules/`, so no engine source is ever committed;
- the Vite config marks `@woosh/meep-engine` external in `build.rollupOptions`, so it cannot
  be inlined into a bundle even by accident;
- no build for distribution is produced at all, and no deployment is configured (brief §3).

The release is source-only. Anyone running it supplies their own licensed copy of meep.

### D-003: Vite 6 and Vitest 3

**Vite** because meep is deep-import-only ESM with ~6000 modules and no bundled entry point;
a dev server that serves native ESM without a bundling step is the only setup where a
cold-start edit-refresh cycle stays usable at that module count. It also makes the
externalisation in D-002 a one-line config rather than a plugin.

**Vitest** because meep itself is tested with Vitest, so its own test utilities and any future
fixture-sharing work without a second runner's semantics in the way. It shares Vite's
resolution, which matters: the deep `.js` imports must resolve identically in tests and in the
app, or the pmove oracle would be testing a differently-resolved module graph than the one
that ships.

### D-004: TypeScript `strict`, with `skipLibCheck: true` under protest

`strict: true`, plus `noImplicitOverride`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`,
`verbatimModuleSyntax` and `isolatedModules`.

`skipLibCheck: true` is set because meep's published declarations do not typecheck standalone
— see GAP-001 in `REPORT.md`. This is recorded as a gap rather than absorbed silently, per the
brief's instruction that type quality is a finding and not an inconvenience. The port's own
code uses no `any` to work around engine types; where a meep type is wrong or missing, the
port declares a local corrective type and the instance goes in the gap register.

Two strict-adjacent flags are deliberately **off**:

- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` — the ported physics code is dense array indexing over
  fixed-size plane and brush tables. Turning it on produces thousands of non-null assertions
  in code whose whole purpose is to be a line-by-line-auditable translation of C, which
  defeats the point of the translation being auditable.
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` — friction with meep's JSDoc-derived optional properties, no
  benefit to this port.

### D-005: Reference sources pinned by commit, not by tag

Both `OpenArena/gamecode` and `ioquake/ioq3` are still receiving commits. A branch or tag
reference would let the balance numbers drift under the port, and — worse — let the pmove
oracle drift under the movement tests, turning a green differential suite red for reasons
unrelated to the port. `tools/fetch-sources.mjs` pins:

- `oa-gamecode` @ `5478aad23b12857d265103f6aa2f5258c78799c8`
- `ioq3` @ `588393618dbc82e7207c21c6ddecca229944a03a`

### D-006: The `trap_` matrix is generated, not written

`tools/trap-matrix.mjs` greps the pinned gamecode for `trap_*` and joins the result against a
hand-written classification in `tools/trap-classification.json`. It exits non-zero if the
gamecode uses a syscall the classification does not cover, and splices the table into
`REPORT.md` between markers.

The matrix is the spine of the report, and a hand-maintained table of 309 rows would be wrong
within a day. Generating it means "complete" is a property the tooling checks rather than a
claim in prose. It also settles the count honestly: of 309 distinct symbols, 205 belong to
subsystems this port deletes wholesale (botlib, AAS, netcode, CD keys, cinematics, server
browser), which is worth stating before anyone reads the raw number as a measure of what an
engine must provide.

### D-007: Collision is ported, not mapped onto meep's physics

meep ships a rigid-body engine with GJK+EPA, CCD, a two-tree BVH broadphase and a kinematic
first-person character controller — on paper, exactly what a shooter needs. This port uses
none of it for player movement, and that is not a criticism of it.

Q3 movement is *defined* by the exact behaviour of `CM_BoxTrace`: which plane it reports when
a sweep straddles a brush edge, how `allsolid`/`startsolid` are flagged, the `1/32` unit
surface offset, and how `PM_SlideMove` clips velocity against up to five accumulated planes.
Strafe-jumping, ramp-jumps and air control are emergent from those specifics. Any other
narrowphase — however correct — produces different contact normals and therefore a different
game. Since the brief makes movement fidelity non-negotiable and everything else replaceable,
`cm_*` is ported verbatim and meep's physics is left for the things where drift is acceptable
(gibs, debris, ragdolls).

Consequence for the report: 19 syscalls sit in the `ported` column. That column is not a gap
list. It is the boundary of where fidelity beats integration, and it is worth the maintainer
knowing that a physics engine being excellent does not make it substitutable here.

### D-008: The pmove oracle is Emscripten-built, per the brief

Emscripten 6.0.8 is installed to `.refs/emsdk` (gitignored). Docker was present on the host
but its daemon was not running, and starting it was not this port's business; a local emsdk
is self-contained and makes the oracle build reproducible from `tools/` alone.

The alternative — a native binary exchanging test vectors over stdio — would have been an
equally valid oracle and slightly less setup. WASM wins because it runs in-process under
Vitest, so the differential test is a normal unit test with no subprocess, no serialisation
format to keep in sync, and no second thing to install in CI.

### D-009: Assets are fetched, never committed

The OA 0.8.8 archive is 425 MB. `tools/fetch-assets.mjs` downloads it and verifies the
SHA-256 recorded in `ASSETS.md`; `assets/` is gitignored in full. Verifying the hash rather
than trusting the URL matters because SourceForge serves through rotating mirrors.

### D-010: Windows path handling in tooling

`tools/fetch-sources.mjs` initially used the common
``import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}` `` entry-point guard, which is wrong on
Windows: `process.argv[1]` is `H:\git\...` and the correct URL is `file:///H:/git/...` —
three slashes and a drive letter. The guard silently evaluated false and the script did
nothing, exiting 0. All tooling now uses `pathToFileURL()`. Noted because it is the kind of
silent no-op that costs an hour when it happens inside CI rather than in front of you.
